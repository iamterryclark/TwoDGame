#OSC Asteroids Style Game (Mac Only)
This is a game build with openFrameworks to develop my knowledge of C++.

To run this game you need to have the following software & ofAddons:

- [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/software/touchosc)
This is so that you can load the controller onto a phone. *currently only layout is iPhone 5* (Feel free to create your own layouts)

- ofxOsc
This already comes with openFrameworks but just make sure this is in the openFrameworks addons folder.

#Setup
- Once you have loaded the TouchOSC controller onto your phone then make sure you set the '*Host IP address*' to the same as your laptop.
- Open & Run the openFrameworks project
- Move joypad on the mobile device and allow the incoming connection.
- Kill the enemies!
